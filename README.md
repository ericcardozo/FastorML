# FastorML
This repository contains a work-in-progress deep learning library implemented in C++ using the Fastor Fastor Tensor Library. The library is designed for learning purposes and provides a set of tools and algorithms for building and training deep neural networks.

This library has been designed taking into account the principles of modern C++ programming, incorporating features like move semantics, smart pointers, and templates to maximize performance, efficiency and safety in the codebase.
